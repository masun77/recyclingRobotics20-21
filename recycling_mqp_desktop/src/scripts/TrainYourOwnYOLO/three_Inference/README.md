# TrainYourOwnYOLO: Inference
In this step, we test our detector on cat and dog images and videos located in [`TrainYourOwnYOLO/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images). If you like to test the detector on your own images or videos, place them in the [`Test_Images`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images) folder. 

## Testing Your Detector
To detect objects run the detector script from within the [`TrainYourOwnYOLO/3_Inference`](/3_Inference/) directory:.
```
python Detector.py
```
The outputs are saved to [`TrainYourOwnYOLO/Data/Source_Images/Test_Image_Detection_Results`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Image_Detection_Results). The outputs include the original images with bounding boxes and confidence scores as well as a file called [`Detection_Results.csv`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Image_Detection_Results/Detection_Results.csv) containing the image file paths and the bounding box coordinates. For videos, the output files are videos with bounding boxes and confidence scores. For real-time detection use `python Detector.py --webcam` this will open up your webcam and detect your data classes. To list available command line options run `python Detector.py -h`.

## [MQP] camera_detector_helper and map
- camera_detector_helper: A conversion of the Detector.py file to run on a single numpy array. Has setup, processImage(npyArray), and close() functions.
- map: a clone of the map gihub repo by

  author={J. {Cartucho} and R. {Ventura} and M. {Veloso}},

}
 to calculate the mean average precision on the detections. To use, place test annotations
 in the input/ground-truth folder and detected annotations in the input/detection-results folder.
 The file convertCsvToTextFiles.py has functions to convert a vott annotations .csv and
 a Detection_Results.csv to appropriate text files.
